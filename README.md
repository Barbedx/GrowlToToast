# GrowlToToast

Implements a Growl Display with a companion program to forward them to Windows 10 Toast notifications.

* Sends Growl titles and messages
* Supports configurable "silent" mode

## Requirements

* Windows 10

This is untested with but will probably not work on Windows 8.

## Installation

Grab the latest release, and extract the ZIP into `%LocalAppData%\Growl\Displays\GrowlToToast` so that `Growler.dll` and the `Toaster` *folder* are both within the `GrowlToToast` folder.
